# Java-2D-Platformer
A 2D Platformer game, created in Java, in my junior year of high school for the Georgia Regional Technology Competition. I started this project with no prior knowledge of Java and used this project to teach myself Java, which was ultimately very enjoyable and time-consuming.

One of the most impressive features of this program is it's ability to load an image file, convert that image into a geometric area, and then use that area as a boundary or map for the player to act upon.
